# Custom Segmented Display

This project is a customizable Segmented display, consisting of a PCB and a top 3d printed diffuser part.
It comes with 32 0603 LEDs arranged in 3 digits, 5-LED light bar and 4 custom indicators. For the top cover, it's mainly a 3d printed part, with tracing paper acting as a diffuser. I'm using double sided adhesive sheets to place the diffusing film on top of the 3d print.

# Key features:
- **32 LEDs**
- **3 digits** (7 segment digit) including two dots
- 5-LED bar on the bottom left corner
- based on **2 AW9523** ICs: cheap and efficient
- **I²C** communication: up to 2 modules on the same I²C bus
- each LED is driven in constant current, with 256 levels of brightness
- The top diffuser 3d printed part can be swapped with a custom made diffuser, so multiple segmented displays fonts can be achieved. Here is a link of an awesome video made by Pozy, exploring custom Segmented Display fonts: *Segmented Displays* link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTB5XhjbgZA&t=301s. I designed a top cover taking inspiration from the ***Seamless*** font (4:35)
